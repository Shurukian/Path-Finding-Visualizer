### [Path Finding Visualizer](https://shurukian.github.io/Path-Finding-Visualizer/)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].

## Technologies used

- React
- JSX
- CSS

## Unsolved Problems
- Would like to add more algorithms
- Would like to be able to click on the different cells to place the start and the end points. 

## Planning Story
 During my bootcamp I had a hard time with algorithms and data structures. I wanted to create a project that would help me to learn more about them while also progressing my coding skills. I was able to find inspiriation from various youtube channels and Medium articles to create a visualizer to start.
